# Solar Data Padding Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a full year (2024) of solar power data by padding the missing days with averaged hourly patterns from the available data.

## Files Created

### 1. **solar_data_full_year_padded.csv**
- **Location**: `solar_power_data/solar_data_full_year_padded.csv`
- **Total hours**: 8,784 (complete year including leap day)
- **Date range**: January 1, 2024 00:00 to December 31, 2024 23:00
- **Timezone**: US Central (UTC-06:00)

## Data Composition

### Original Data (32.8%)
- **Hours**: 2,883
- **Coverage**: First ~10-13 days of each month
- **Source**: Real measurements from solar power system

### Padded Data (67.2%)
- **Hours**: 5,901
- **Coverage**: Remaining days of each month
- **Method**: Average hourly pattern calculated from available data

## Padding Methodology

The script uses a **hourly pattern averaging** approach:

1. **Calculate average for each hour** (0-23) across all available days
2. **Apply the pattern** to missing hours based on their hour-of-day
3. **Preserve solar cycle**: Maintains realistic day/night patterns
   - Low/zero values during night hours (0-5, 21-23)
   - Peak generation during midday hours (11-14)
   - Gradual rise in morning (6-10) and fall in evening (15-20)

## Data Columns

- `interval_start_local` - Start of hourly interval (local time)
- `interval_end_local` - End of hourly interval (local time)  
- `interval_start_utc` - Start time in UTC
- `interval_end_utc` - End time in UTC
- `cop_hsl_system_wide` - Solar generation metric 1
- `stppf_system_wide` - Solar generation metric 2
- `pvgrpp_system_wide` - Solar generation metric 3
- `gen_system_wide` - (mostly NaN in original data)
- `hsl_system_wide` - (mostly NaN in original data)

## Typical Daily Pattern (from averaged data)

| Hour | Solar Output (cop_hsl_system_wide) |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| 0-5  | ~2.4 MW (nighttime baseline)      |
| 6    | ~25 MW (sunrise)                  |
| 7    | ~1,095 MW (morning ramp-up)       |
| 8-10 | 5,581 - 11,040 MW (rising)        |
| 11-14| 11,636 - 12,022 MW (peak)         |
| 15-17| 11,393 - 7,055 MW (declining)     |
| 18-20| 4,009 - 96 MW (sunset)            |
| 21-23| ~2.4 MW (nighttime baseline)      |

## Usage Notes

✅ **Good for**: 
- System modeling and simulations
- Testing algorithms that need full-year data
- Capacity planning exercises
- Educational purposes

⚠️ **Limitations**:
- Padded data doesn't capture day-to-day weather variations
- Seasonal differences are averaged out
- Special events (storms, maintenance) not represented
- Should not be used for precise forecasting or financial analysis

## Next Steps

For production use or critical analysis, consider:
1. Obtaining complete historical data from your solar data source
2. Using weather-based solar generation models for missing periods
3. Applying seasonal adjustments to the padded values
4. Validating padded values against nearby solar installations
